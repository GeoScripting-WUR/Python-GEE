    "Many of you will know or have scrolled around in [google earth](https://earth.google.com/web/). Within Google Earth it is possible to expplore the earth behind your computer. Through the application a lot of different maps and information can be found, some straight forward such as the normal google maps base map, but also layers such as the age of the sea floor. Additionally, (or primarily if you ask geospatial people) it is a powerful cloud based computational platform where geospatial analysis can be carried out. All this information and all tools are gathered, and made available to everybody (with a google account...) in the \"engine\" behind Google Earth: Google Earth Engine (GEE). GEE was originally developed and made available as a _JavaScript API_. What does that exacly mean? Let's break it up into Javascript and API. \n",
    "\n",
    "### API\n",
    "An API is a \"Application Programming Interface\", which is a standard language (or a set of rules) with wich pieces of software can commincate with eachother. API's are used for for example [accessing data](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3#how) or to interact with the [command line tool: GDAL](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/PythonRaster/) like we did yesterday. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript  \n",
    "JavaScript (JS) is a widely used programming language, primarily for interacting with website. Javascript is an object oriented programming language, which means that it focuses on creating reusable code through objects. Objects can encapsulate both data (properties) and functionality (methods) in one single object. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programing paradigm which is slightly different than how we have programmed so far. Python is also, or can also be used as, an OOP language. Working with the GEE Python API is a great oportunity to get familiair with object oriented programming while at the same time work with the extremely powerful engine from google. "

    "This is a simple example, but you can imagine that these can get very complex.

It is very complicated and hard to read, but very well documented so try to understand some of its functionality! The method [`to_json`](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas/blob/main/geopandas/geoseries.py#L1209) contains very straight forward functionality (but it might still be hard to read).\n",

    "```python \n",
    "class GeoSeries:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is that the code in the brackets is how \"inheritance\" is implemented. The class will _inherit_ all the functionality of the classes passed as arguments, in this case `GeoPandasBase` and `Series`. The `Series` object refers to the [Pandas.Series](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/core/series.py#L243C15-L243C15) object containing 6000 lines of code containing all sorts of functionality. In this way, the GeoPandas series contains all the functionality that is implemented in pandas *plus* all the functionality from GeoPandasBase *plus* all the functionality implemented in GeoPandas.Series itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pfew, that's a lot of very complicated code and maybe a bit very overwelming and you do not need to understand all of it. The important thing to understand is the value of classes, objects and inheritance. How does this work in a simple example? \n",
    "\n",
    "So we established that with inheritance we can allow classes to take all the functionality from other classes and build on that. So let's create a new object called `Student`, which will inherit all properties and methods from `Person` which we created earlier. \n"
