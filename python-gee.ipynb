    "Many of you may already be familiar with or have explored Google Earth (https://earth.google.com/web/). Within Google Earth, you can virtually explore the Earth from your computer. The application offers various maps and information, including the familiar Google Maps base map and additional layers such as the age of the sea floor. Moreover, Google Earth (or more accurately, its \"engine\") serves as a powerful cloud-based computational platform for geospatial analysis. It provides a wealth of information and tools that are accessible to everyone (with a Google account).\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Earth Engine (GEE) is the underlying platform behind Google Earth, initially developed and released as a JavaScript API. But what exactly does that mean? Let's break it down into JavaScript and API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API\n",
    "An API stands for \"Application Programming Interface\" and serves as a standardized language or set of rules that allows different software components to communicate with each other. APIs are commonly used for tasks such as accessing data (e.g., weather data from OpenWeatherMap) or interacting with  [a command line tool: GDAL](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/PythonRaster/) with python or R, as we covered in the previous tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript\n",
    "JavaScript (JS) is a widely used programming language primarily employed for web development. It follows an object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, which emphasizes creating reusable code through objects. Objects in JS can encapsulate both data (properties) and functionality (methods) within a single entity. OOP differs somewhat from the programming style we have used thus far, although Python can also be used as an OOP language. Working with the GEE Python API offers a fantastic opportunity to become familiar with object-oriented programming while leveraging the immense power of Google's engine."

It may seem complicated and hard to read, but it is well-documented, so try to understand some of its functionality.

    "\n",
    "So, we've learned that with inheritance, classes can acquire all the functionality from other classes and build upon that. Let's create a new object called `Student`, which will inherit all the properties and methods from the `Person` class we created earlier."
